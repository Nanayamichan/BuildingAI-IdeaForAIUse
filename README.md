# Pokémon Card Scanning

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The idea is to use a database of cards from the Pokémon TCG and create a scanner of sorts that can recognise said card and add it into the collection (in another software.) 


## Background

I've made a software already. http://www.kindbergs.dk/pokemon-tcg-pokedex/
that's my motivation for thinking of doing this. 

Problems:
* problem 1 - I'm not sure where to even start or what type of AI to use.
* problem 2 - I'm gonna need help.


## How is it used?

It would be used to easily scan pokémon cards and then add them into the (http://www.kindbergs.dk/pokemon-tcg-pokedex/) software i've made. 
So you have an easy way to add cards to your collection immediately!

## Data sources and AI methods

The data source could be my database of images created with my software for storing what you collect/have. 

## Challenges

This is a challenge. It's pretty much already described....


## Acknowledgments

* Justinbasil.com was my inspiration. That someone could dedicate so much and share it for free just because they love the game, the TCG. May he RIP.
